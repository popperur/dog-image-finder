# Dog Image Finder

Looking for dog breeds you've never heard of? This app helps you discover and learn about all kinds of dogs through
images, including rare breeds like the majestic Kuvasz!

## Purpose
Dog Image Finder is a tiny React + TypeScript single-page app for browsing and discovering dog images powered by the public Dog CEO API (https://dog.ceo/). It showcases UI/UX patterns with Ant Design and styled-components, includes animated backgrounds, and an optional audio toggle for a playful experience. The codebase demonstrates modern frontend practices (Vite, strict TypeScript, RTL + Vitest).


Be sure to listen to the strange sounds emanating from one of the craters on the moon. What the hell, right?! 
Spooky!
